Hey there! I'm Vitoria, a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Pennsylvania. I work in the [Brachio Lab](https://brachiolab.github.io/) ðŸ¦• under the supervision of Professor [Eric Wong](https://riceric22.github.io/). My research focuses on machine learning interpretability and broader topics in trustworthy ML.

I earned my Master of Science in Mathematical Modelling in 2023 and my Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics in 2020 from the School of Applied Mathematics at [FundaÃ§Ã£o Getulio Vargas](https://portal.fgv.br/).  During my studies, I was part of the [Visual Data Science Lab](http://www.visualdslab.com/) and worked with Professors [Jorge Poco](http://visualdslab.com/~jpocom/) and [Marcos M. Raimundo](https://ic.unicamp.br/~mraimundo/). My research focused on machine learning, multi-objective optimization, and fairness in ML.

After my master's, I worked as a research scientist at the [Visualization and Data Analytics Research Center](https://vida.engineering.nyu.edu/) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/) with Professor [Claudio Silva](https://ctsilva.github.io/). At NYU, I focused on visualization systems for Explainable AI and topological data analysis, developing tools to help interpret complex ML models.

My research interests include Machine Learning, Trustworthy ML, ML Interpretability, and Optimization.

Thanks for stopping by!
