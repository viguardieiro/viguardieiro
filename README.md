Hi! I am currently a Master's student at the Visual Data Science Lab ([V-DS](http://www.visualdslab.com/)) in the School of Applied Mathematics ([EMAp](https://emap.fgv.br/)) of Funda√ß√£o Getulio Vargas ([FGV](https://portal.fgv.br/)), working with professors [Jorge Poco](https://vgc.poly.edu/~jpocom/) and [Marcos M. Raimundo](https://marcosmrai.github.io/). I obtained my B.S. in Applied Mathematics from FGV/EMAp in 2020 under the supervision of Jorge Poco and Marcos M. Raimundo. 

I am interested in Machine Learning, Optimization (with a focus but not limited to Multi-Objective Optimization), and Statistics. 

My current research is focused on developing ethical Machine Learning models, specifically employing Multi-Objective Optimization and Ensemble Learning methods to learn fair ML models.
